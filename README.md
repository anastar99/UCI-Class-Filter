# UCI-Class-Filter


Do you spend minutes copy and pasting a proffesors name into RMP then you finally find one with a good rating only to slide your finger to right to see that the class interferes with another one of your classes or its fucken full? lol

This small script:

Lets you filter the classes offered for a certain "subject" (class code) based on 
 - RMP ratings
 - date
 - time
 - availability
